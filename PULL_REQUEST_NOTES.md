- **Pricing validation** with tier-based discount limits (30%/20%/10%)
- **Duplicate detection** with 85%+ similarity fuzzy matching
- **Deal size limits** based on partner tier
- **Documentation requirements** based on deal value

### ‚ö° Approval Workflows
- **Configurable workflows** based on deal characteristics
- **Auto-approval** for deals under threshold ($25k for some tiers)
- **Multi-level approval** (Staff ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Admin)
- **High-value escalation** (>$50k requires manager, >$100k requires admin)
- **Bulk approval** capabilities for administrators
- **Appeal process** through escalation mechanism

### üìä Status Tracking
- **Primary status**: pending, assigned, disputed, approved, rejected
- **Substatus**: submitted, under_review, approval_pending, manager_review, admin_review, etc.
- **Complete audit trail** with timestamps and user attribution
- **Activity timeline** showing all status changes
- **Priority levels** (1-5 scale) with visual indicators

### üîî Notification System
- **7 notification types**: deal_submitted, approval_required, deal_approved, etc.
- **In-app notifications** with read/unread status
- **Email templates** ready for service integration
- **Automated alerts** for workflow events
- **Bulk notification management**

### üìù Multi-Step Form
- **Step 1**: Basic Information (reseller, priority, timeline, description)
- **Step 2**: End User Information (search, create, duplicate detection)
- **Step 3**: Products & Pricing (dynamic products, validation, calculations)
- **Step 4**: Review & Submit (comprehensive overview, final validation)
- **Draft persistence** with automatic saving
- **Resume functionality** for interrupted sessions

## üöÄ Technical Highlights

### Type Safety
- **25+ TypeScript interfaces** for complete type safety
- **Zod schemas** for runtime validation
- **Comprehensive error types** for better debugging

### Performance
- **Optimized database queries** with proper joins and indexes
- **Batch operations** for bulk processing
- **Efficient state management** across components

### Security
- **Row Level Security** policies for data protection
- **Input validation** at multiple layers
- **Audit trail** for compliance requirements

### Scalability
- **Configurable business rules** stored in database
- **Modular architecture** for easy extension
- **Event-driven notifications** for loose coupling
