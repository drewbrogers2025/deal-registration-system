## üìä Performance Impact

- **Permission Checking**: Optimized database queries with caching
- **Audit Logging**: Asynchronous logging to avoid blocking
- **Rate Limiting**: Memory fallback for high availability
- **UI Components**: Efficient permission checking with React hooks

## üîÑ Migration Required

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor
\i supabase/security-schema.sql
```

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256
- RLS policies protect data access at the database level
- Audit logging tracks all data access and modifications
- Data retention policies ensure compliance

### API Security
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- Input validation protects against injection attacks
- Security headers prevent common web vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization on all protected endpoints

### User Security
- Strong password policies prevent weak passwords
- Account lockout prevents brute force attacks
- Session management prevents session hijacking
- Two-factor authentication adds extra security layer

## üìñ Documentation

- [x] Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- [x] README updated with security information
- [x] SECURITY.md provides comprehensive implementation guide
- [x] API documentation includes security requirements
- [x] Usage examples provided for all components
