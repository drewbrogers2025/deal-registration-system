## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Deal with Enhanced Workflow
```typescript
// Navigate to /deals/new-enhanced
// Complete 4-step wizard with validation
// Automatic workflow determination and notification
```

### 2. Processing Approvals
```typescript
// POST /api/deals/{id}/approve
{
  "action": "approve",
  "comments": "Approved based on customer requirements"
}
```

### 3. Bulk Approval
```typescript
// POST /api/deals/bulk-approve
{
  "deal_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "approver_id": "staff-uuid",
  "comments": "Bulk approval for Q4 deals"
}
```

### 4. Saving Drafts
```typescript
// POST /api/deals/drafts
{
  "reseller_id": "uuid",
  "step_completed": 2,
  "draft_data": {
    "step1": {...},
    "step2": {...}
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration

### Approval Workflows
Workflows are configured in the `approval_workflows` table with JSON conditions and steps:

```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "max_deal_value": 50000,
    "partner_tiers": ["gold", "silver", "bronze"]
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "role": "staff",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "role": "manager",
      "required": false,
      "auto_approve_threshold": 25000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Business Rules
Validation rules are stored in `eligibility_rules` table:

```json
{
  "rule_type": "deal_size",
  "conditions": {
    "max_value": 100000,
    "applies_to_tiers": ["silver", "bronze"]
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Database Migration**: Apply the schema changes to your Supabase instance
2. **Authentication Integration**: Connect the placeholder user IDs to actual auth context
3. **Email Service**: Integrate with SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar for email notifications
4. **File Upload**: Implement document upload functionality
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage
6. **UI Polish**: Enhance the user interface based on feedback

## ðŸ“Š Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved User Experience**: Multi-step form with draft saving
2. **Better Data Quality**: Enhanced validation prevents errors
3. **Streamlined Approvals**: Automated workflow reduces manual overhead
4. **Better Communication**: Notification system keeps stakeholders informed
5. **Audit Compliance**: Complete status tracking and history
6. **Scalability**: Configurable rules and workflows
7. **Efficiency**: Bulk operations for administrative tasks

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for deal registration with enterprise-grade workflow management capabilities.
